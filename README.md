# xv6_simpleshell
A custom shell implemented for the xv6 operating system as part of a university coursework project. This shell includes core features like command execution, input/output redirection, multi-element pipelines, and sequential command execution, designed to demonstrate a deep understanding of operating system principles.

# Features
* Command Execution: Execute simple and complex commands with support for whitespace variations.
* Input/Output Redirection: Handle input (<) and output (>) redirection seamlessly.
* Pipelines: Support two-element and multi-element pipelines (e.g., ls | grep test | cat).
* Sequential Commands: Execute multiple commands in sequence using the ; operator.
* Edge Case Handling: Robust against varied command formats, such as extra spaces or unusual input patterns.
